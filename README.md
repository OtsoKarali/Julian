# Julian Quant Platform

## What is Julian?

Julian is a modern, modular quant research and trading platform. It's not just another analytics tool—it's my personal research lab, trading cockpit, and a canvas for building, testing, and visualizing real strategies. Every pixel and API call is here because I wanted it to be.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a quant platform that felt as good to use as the best trading dashboards out there—something I could be proud of, that reflects real effort and attention to detail. Every feature, every chart, every bit of glow was built with care. This is my playground, my research lab, and my trading cockpit.
